In the next two months, I want to build software that...

...makes my app work. 
Has the player beat a boss that progressively gets stronger and harder to beat, as you beat the boss over and over.
Is able have the player choose whether they want to increase damage speed or health after beating a boss.
End goal: it saves a players high score to a server that shows your rank within a group of people.
